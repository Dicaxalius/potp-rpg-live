 * Introduction
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * The Battle Core plugin revamps the battle engine provided by RPG Maker MZ to
 * become more flexible, streamlined, and support a variety of features. The
 * updated battle engine allows for custom Action Sequences, battle layout
 * styles, and a lot of control over the battle mechanics, too.
 *
 * Features include all (but not limited to) the following:
 * 
 * * Action Sequence Plugin Commands to give you full control over what happens
 *   during the course of a skill or item.
 * * Animated Sideview Battler support for enemies!
 * * Auto Battle options for party-wide and actor-only instances.
 * * Base Troop Events to quickly streamline events for all Troop events.
 * * Battle Command control to let you change which commands appear for actors.
 * * Battle Layout styles to change the way the battle scene looks.
 * * Casting animation support for skills.
 * * Critical Hit control over the success rate formula and damage multipliers.
 * * Custom target scopes added for skills and items.
 * * Damage formula control, including Damage Styles.
 * * Damage caps, both hard caps and soft caps.
 * * Damage traits such Armor Penetration/Reduction to bypass defenses.
 * * Elements & Status Menu Core support for traits.
 * * Multitude of JavaScript notetags and global Plugin Parameters to let you
 *   make a variety of effects across various instances during battle.
 * * Party Command window can be skipped/disabled entirely.
 * * Weather effects now show in battle.
 * * Streamlined Battle Log to remove redundant information and improve the
 *   flow of battle.
 * * Visual HP Gauges can be displayed above the heads of actors and/or enemies
 *   with a possible requirement for enemies to be defeated at least once first
 *   in order for them to show.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * Requirements
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * This plugin is made for RPG Maker MZ. This will not work in other iterations
 * of RPG Maker.
 *
 * ------ Tier 1 ------
 *
 * This plugin is a Tier 1 plugin. Place it under other plugins of lower tier
 * value on your Plugin Manager list (ie: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). This is to ensure
 * that your plugins will have the best compatibility with the rest of the
 * VisuStella MZ library.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * Major Changes
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * This plugin will overwrite some core parts of the RPG Maker MZ base code in
 * order to ensure the Battle Core plugin will work at full capacity. The
 * following are explanations of what has been changed.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Action Sequences
 *
 * - Action sequences are now done either entirely by the Battle Log Window or
 * through common events if the <Custom Action Sequence> notetag is used.
 * In RPG Maker MZ by default, Action Sequences would be a mixture of using the
 * Battle Log Window, the Battle Manager, and the Battle Scene, making it hard
 * to fully grab control of the situation.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Action Speed
 *
 * - Action speeds determine the turn order in the default battle system. The
 * AGI of a battle unit is also taken into consideration. However, the random
 * variance applied to the action speed system makes the turn order extremely
 * chaotic and hard for the player to determine. Thus, the random variance
 * aspect of it has been turned off. This can be reenabled by default through
 * Plugin Parameters => Mechanics Settings => Allow Random Speed?
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Animated Sideview Battler Support For Enemies
 *
 * - Enemies can now use Sideview Actor sprites for themselves! They will
 * behave like actors and can even carry their own set of weapons for physical
 * attacks. These must be set up using notetags. More information can be found
 * in the notetag section.
 *
 * - As the sprites are normally used for actors, some changes have been made
 * to Sprite_Actor to be able to support both actors and enemies. These changes
 * should have minimal impact on other plugins.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Battle Sprite Updates
 *
 * - A lot of functions in Sprite_Battler, Sprite_Actor, and Sprite_Enemy have
 * been overwritten to make the new Action Sequence system added by this plugin
 * possible. These changes make it possible for the sprites to move anywhere on
 * the screen, jump, float, change visibility, and more.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Change Battle Back in Battle
 * 
 * - By default, the Change Battle Back event command does not work in battle.
 * Any settings made to it will only reflect in the following battle. Now, if
 * the battle back event command is used during battle, it will reflect upon
 * any new changes immediately.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Critical Hit - LUK Influence
 *
 * - The LUK Buffs now affect the critical hit rate based off how the formula
 * is now calculated. Each stack of a LUK Buff will double the critical hit
 * rate and compound upon that. That means a x1 LUK Buff stack will raise it by
 * x2, a x2 LUK Buff stack will raise the critical hit rate by x4, a x3 LUK
 * Buff Stack will raise the critical hit rate stack by x8, and so on.
 *
 * - LUK also plays a role in how much damage is dealt with critical hits. The
 * default critical hit multiplier has been reduced from x3 to x2. However, a
 * percentage of LUK will added on (based off the user's CRI rate) onto the
 * finalized critical damage. If the user's CRI rate is 4%, then 4% of the user
 * LUK value will also be added onto the damage.
 *
 * - This change can be altered through Plugin Parameters => Damage Settings =>
 * Critical Hits => JS: Rate Formula and JS: Damage Formula.
 *
 * ---
 * 
 * Damage Popups
 * 
 * - Damage popups are now formatted with + and - to determine healing and
 * damage. MP Damage will also include "MP" at the back. This is to make it
 * clearer what each colored variant of the damage popup means as well as help
 * color blind players read the on-screen data properly.
 * 
 * - Damage popups have also been rewritten to show all changed aspects instead
 * of just one. Previously with RPG Maker MZ, if an action would deal both HP
 * and MP damage, only one of them would show. Now, everything is separated and
 * both HP and MP changes will at a time.
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * Dual Wielding
 * 
 * - Previously, RPG Maker MZ had "Dual Wielding" attack using both weapon
 * animations at once, with the combined ATK of each weapon. It's confusing to
 * look at and does not portray the nature of "Dual Wielding".
 * 
 * - Dual Wielding, or in the case of users adding in third and fourth weapons,
 * Multi Wielding is now changed. Each weapon is displayed individually, each
 * producing its own attack animation, showing each weapon type, and applying
 * only that weapon's ATK, Traits, and related effects. It is no longer a
 * combined effect to display everything at once like RPG Maker MZ default.
 * 
 * - If an actor has multiple weapon slots but some of them are unequipped,
 * then the action will treat the attack as a single attack. There will be no
 * barehanded attack to add on top of it. This is to match RPG Maker MZ's
 * decision to omit a second animation if the same scenario is applied.
 * 
 * ---
 *
 * Force Action
 *
 * - Previously, Forced Actions would interrupt the middle of an event to
 * perform an action. However, with the addition of more flexible Action
 * Sequences, the pre-existing Force Action system would not be able to exist
 * and would require being remade.
 *
 * - Forced Actions now are instead, added to a separate queue from the action
 * battler list. Whenever an action and/or common event is completed, then if
 * there's a Forced Action battler queued, then the Forced Action battler will
 * have its turn. This is the cleanest method available and avoids the most
 * conflicts possible.
 *
 * - This means if you planned to make cinematic sequences with Forced Actions,
 * you will need to account for the queued Force Actions. However, in the case
 * of battle cinematics, we would highly recommend that you use the newly added
 * Action Sequence Plugin Commands instead as those give you more control than
 * any Force Action ever could.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Random Scope
 *
 * - The skill and item targeting scopes for Random Enemy, 2 Random Enemies,
 * 3 Random Enemies, 4 Random Enemies will now ignore TGR and utilize true
 * randomness.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Spriteset_Battle Update
 *
 * - The spriteset now has extra containers to separate battlers (actors and
 * enemies), animations, and damage. This is to make actors and enemy battler
 * sprites more efficient to sort (if enabled), so that animations won't
 * interfere with and cover damage sprites, and to make sure damage sprites are
 * unaffected by screen tints in order to ensure the player will always have a
 * clear read on the information relaying sprites.
 *
 * ---
 * 
 * TPB/ATB Active Battle Actor Shifting
 * 
 * - Pressing cancel on the Actor Command Window no longer switches between
 * actors with a full TPB/ATB gauge before reaching the Party Command Window.
 * This is to accomplish a couple of things: 1) reduce the number of button
 * presses to reach the Party Command Window and 2) to prevent motion resets
 * and disrupting action sequences. If this feature is vital to your battle
 * system, we recommend that you do not use this plugin or any of the Battle
 * Core-required plugins.
 * 
 * ---
 *
 * Weather Displayed in Battle
 *
 * - Previously, weather has not been displayed in battle. This means that any
 * weather effects placed on the map do not transfer over to battle and causes
 * a huge disconnect for players. The Battle Core plugin will add weather
 * effects to match the map's weather conditions. Any changes made to weather
 * through event commands midway through battle will also be reflected.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * Base Troops
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * Base Troops can be found, declared, and modified in the Plugin Parameters =>
 * Mechanics Settings => Base Troop ID's. All of the listed Troop ID's here
 * will have their page events replicated and placed under all other troops
 * found in the database.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * This means that if you have an event that runs on Turn 1 of a Base Troop,
 * then for every troop out there, that same event will also run on Turn 1,
 * as well. This is useful for those who wish to customize their battle system
 * further and to reduce the amount of work needed to copy/paste said event
 * pages into every database troop object manually.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * Damage Styles
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * Damage Styles are a new feature added through the Battle Core plugin. When
 * using certain Battle Styles, you can completely ignore typing in the whole
 * damage formula inside the damage formula input box, and instead, insert
 * either a power amount or a multiplier depending on the Damage Style. The
 * plugin will then automatically calculate damage using that value factoring
 * in ATK, DEF, MAT, MDF values.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Here is a list of the Damage Styles that come with this plugin by default.
 * You can add in your own and even edit them to your liking.
 * Or just remove them if you want.
 *
 * - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 * Style          Use Formula As   PH/MA Disparity   Stat Scale   Damage Scale
 * - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 * Standard       Formula          No                Varies       Varies
 * ArmorScaling   Formula          No                Varies       Varies
 * CT             Multiplier       Yes               Low          Normal
 * D4             Multiplier       No                High         Normal
 * DQ             Multiplier       No                Low          Low
 * FF7            Power            Yes               Low          High
 * FF8            Power            Yes               Medium       Normal
 * FF9            Power            Yes               Low          Normal
 * FF10           Power            Yes               Medium       High
 * MK             Multiplier       No                Medium       Low
 * MOBA           Multiplier       No                Medium       Normal
 * PKMN           Power            No                Low          Normal
 *
 * Use the above chart to figure out which Damage Style best fits your game,
 * if you plan on using them.
 *
 * The 'Standard' style is the same as the 'Manual' formula input, except that
 * it allows for the support of <Armor Penetration> and <Armor Reduction>
 * notetags.
 *
 * The 'Armor Scaling' style allows you to type in the base damage calculation
 * without the need to type in any defending modifiers.
 *
 * NOTE: While these are based off the damage formulas found in other games,
 * not all of them are exact replicas. Many of them are adapted for use in
 * RPG Maker MZ since not all RPG's use the same set of parameters and not all
 * external multipliers function the same way as RPG Maker MZ.
 * 
 * ---
 *
 * Style:
 * - This is what the Damage Style is.
 *
 * Use Formula As:
 * - This is what you insert into the formula box.
 * - Formula: Type in the formula for the action just as you would normally.
 * - Multiplier: Type in the multiplier for the action.
 *     Use float values. This means 250% is typed out as 2.50
 * - Power: Type in the power constant for the action.
 *     Use whole numbers. Type in something like 16 for a power constant.
 * 
 * PH/MA Disparity:
 * - Is there a disparity between how Physical Attacks and Magical Attacks
 *   are calculated?
 * - If yes, then physical attacks and magical attacks will have different
 *   formulas used.
 * - If no, then physical attacks and magical attacks will share similar
 *   formulas for how they're calculated.
 *
 * Stat Scale:
 * - How much should stats scale throughout the game?
 * - Low: Keep them under 100 for the best results.
 * - Medium: Numbers work from low to mid 400's for best results.
 * - High: The numbers really shine once they're higher.
 *
 * Damage Scale:
 * - How much does damage vary depending on small parameter changes?
 * - Low: Very little increase from parameter changes.
 * - Normal: Damage scales close to proportionally with parameter changes.
 * - High: Damage can boost itself drastically with parameter changes.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * To determine what kind of parameters are used for the Damage Styles, they
 * will depend on two things: the action's 'Hit Type' (ie Physical Attack,
 * Magical Attack, and Certain Hit) and the action's 'Damage Type' (ie. Damage,
 * Recovery, or Drain).
 *
 * Certain Hit tends to use whichever value is higher: ATK or MAT, and then
 * ignores the target's defense values. Use Certain Hits for 'True Damage'.
 *
 * Use the chart below to figure out everything else:
 * 
 * - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 * Hit Type      Damage Type   Attacker Parameter   Defender Parameter
 * - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 * Physical      Damage        ATK                  DEF
 * Magical       Damage        MAT                  MDF
 * Certain Hit   Damage        Larger (ATK, MAT)    -Ignores-
 * Physical      Recover       DEF                  -Ignores-
 * Magical       Recover       MDF                  -Ignores-
 * Certain Hit   Recover       Larger (ATK, MAT)    -Ignores-
 * Physical      Drain         ATK                  DEF
 * Magical       Drain         MAT                  MDF
 * Certain Hit   Drain         Larger (ATK, MAT)    -Ignores-
 *
 * These can be modified within the Plugin Parameters in the individual
 * Damage Styles themselves.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Skills and Items can use different Damage Styles from the setting you've
 * selected in the Plugin Parameters. They can be altered to have different
 * Damage Styles through the usage of a notetag:
 *
 * <Damage Style: name>
 *
 * This will use whichever style is found in the Plugin Parameters.
 *
 * If "Manual" is used, then no style will be used and all calculations will be
 * made strictly based off the formula found inside the formula box.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * VisuStella MZ Compatibility
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * While this plugin is compatible with the majority of the VisuStella MZ
 * plugin library, it is not compatible with specific plugins or specific
 * features. This section will highlight the main plugins/features that will
 * not be compatible with this plugin or put focus on how the make certain
 * features compatible.
 *
 * ---
 * 
 * VisuMZ_1_BattleCore
 * 
 * When using Action Sequences, Boost effects for damage, turn extensions,
 * analyze, etc. will not occur for anything other than the Action Sequence:
 * "MECH: Action Effect" in order to maintain controlled effects. However, if
 * you do want to apply bonuses for Boosts, utilize "MECH: Boost Store Data" to
 * store inside a variable how many times Boosts were used. This can be used
 * however which way you want it to as long as it is manageable through events
 * and Common Events.
 * 
 * ---
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * Notetags
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * The following are notetags that have been added through this plugin. These
 * notetags will not work with your game if this plugin is OFF or not present.

 *
 * ---
 *
 * <Region x Battleback1: filename>
 * <Region x Battleback2: filename>
 * 
 * - Used for: Map Notetags

 *   'filename' battleback will be used.
 * - Replace 'x' with a number representing the region ID you wish to use.
 * - Replace 'filename' with the filename of the graphic to use. Do not insert
 *   any extensions. This means the file 'Castle1.png' will be only inserted
 *   as 'Castle1' without the '.png' at the end.
 * - *NOTE: This will override any specified battleback settings.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * === Battle Command-Related Notetags ===

 * <Custom Action Sequence>
 *
 * - Used for: Skill, Item Notetags
 * - Removes all automated Action Sequence parts from the skill.
 * - Everything Action Sequence-related will be done by Common Events.
 * - Insert Common Event(s) into the skill/item's effects list to make use of
 *   the Custom Action Sequences.
 * - This will prevent common events from loading in the Item Scene and Skill
 *   Scene when used outside of battle.
 *
 * ---
 * 
 * <Auto Action Sequence>
 * 
 * - Used for: Skill, Item Notetags
 * - If the Action Sequence Plugin Parameter "Auto Notetag" is enabled, this
 *   plugin will prevent custom action sequences from happening for the skill
 *   or item, and instead, use an Automatic Action Sequence instead.
 * - Ignore this if you have "Auto Notetag" disabled or set to false. By
 *   default, this setting is set to false. Please be aware of the changes
 *   you've made to your game before using it.
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * <Bypass Auto Action Sequence>
 * 
 * - Used for: Skill, Item Notetags
 * - This notetag is used for the game devs that have the Action Sequence
 *   Plugin Parameter "Auto Notetag" on for applying <Custom Action Sequence>
 *   to everything.
 * - This will allow items and skills to be able to launch their common
 *   events from the menu scene regardless of the inherent restriction to
 *   prevent action sequence based skills/items with common events from
 *   launching.
 * - Ignore this if you have "Auto Notetag" disabled or set to false. By
 *   default, this setting is set to false. Please be aware of the changes
 *   you've made to your game before using it.

 * 
 * <Common Event: name>
 *
 * - Used for: Skill, Item Notetags
 * - Battle only: calls forth a Common Event of a matching name.
 * - Replace 'name' with the name of a Common Event to call from when this
 *   skill/item is used in battle.
 *   - Remove any \I[x] in the name.
 * - Insert multiple notetags to call multiple Common Events in succession.
 * - This will occur after any Common Event Trait Effects for the skill/item's
 *   database entry.
 * - This is primarily used for users who are reorganizing around their Common
 *   Events and would still like to have their skills/items perform the correct
 *   Action Sequences in case the ID's are different.
 * 
 * ---
 *
 * <Display Icon: x>
 * <Display Text: string>
 *
 * - Used for: Skill, Item Notetags
 * - When displaying the skill/item name in the Action Sequence, determine the
 *   icon and/or text displayed.
 * - Replace 'x' with a number value representing the icon ID to be displayed.
 * - Replace 'string' with a text value representing the displayed name.
 *

 * 
 * <Common Event Key: name>
 * <Common Event Keys: name, name, name>
 * 
 * <Common Event Keys>
 *  key
 *  key
 *  key
 * </Common Event Keys>
 * 
 * - Used for: Skill, Item Notetags
 * - Will generate Common Events for the skill/item with a corresponding key.
 * - Replace 'name' with the name of the Common Event's key that you want to
 *   reference. That key will be converted into a Common Event effect for the
 *   skill/item and be treated as an action sequence.
 *   - The notetag variants that use multiple keys will have the keys added in
 *     the order they are listed.
 *   - If keys do not reference any Common Events, no Common Events will be
 *     added for that key.
 * - To mark a Common Event with a key, insert inside a Common Event's name the
 *   [ and ] brackets around the text that will be used as the Common Event's
 *   key text.
 *   - For example, if Common Event's name is "Penta Slash [PENTA]", then the
 *     key used is "PENTA" without the quotes.
 *   - This key could then be referenced by <Common Event Key: PENTA> notetag.
 *   - Do not use commas (,) inside the key text as it will be automatically
 *     removed for the sake of consistency.
 * - This feature is made for make the process of sharing Action Sequences to
 *   become easier without needing to line up Common Event ID's.

 * === Animated Sideview Battler-Related Notetags ===
 *
 * Enemies can use Animated Sideview Actor graphics thanks to this plugin.
 * These notetags give you control over that aspect. Some of these also affect
 * actors in addition to enemies.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * <Sideview Battler: filename>
 *
 * <Sideview Battlers>
 *  filename: weight
 *  filename: weight
 *  filename: weight
 * </Sideview Battlers>
 *
 * - Used for: Enemy Notetags
 * - Replaces the enemy's battler graphic with an animated Sideview Actor
 *   graphic found in the img/sv_actors/ folder.
 * - Replace 'filename' with the filename of the graphic to use. Do not insert
 *   any extensions. This means the file 'Actor1_1.png' will be only inserted
 *   as 'Actor1_1' without the '.png' at the end.
 * - If the multiple notetag vaiant is used, then a random filename is selected
 *   from the list upon the enemy's creation.
 * - Replace 'weight' with a number value representing how often the 'filename'
 *   would come up. The higher the weight, the more often. You may omit this
 *   and the colon(:) and just type in the 'filename' instead.

 * === Battle Layout-Related Notetags ===
 * 
 * These tags will change the battle layout for a troop regardless of how the
 * plugin parameters are set up normally. Insert these tags in either the
 * noteboxes of maps or the names of troops for them to take effect. If both
 * are present for a specific battle, then priority goes to the setting found
 * in the troop name.
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * <Layout: type>
 * <Battle Layout: type>
 * 
 * - Used for: Map Notetags, Troop Name Tags, and Troop Comment Tags
 * - Changes the battle layout style used for this specific map or battle.
 * - Replace 'type' with 'default', 'list', 'xp', 'portrait', or 'border'.
 * - Those with VisuMZ_3_FrontviewBattleUI can use 'frontview'.
 * - Those with VisuMZ_3_SideviewBattleUI can use 'sideview'.
 * - If using Troop Comment Tags, then as long as the tag appears in a comment
 *   found on any of the Troop's pages (even if they don't run), the tag will
 *   be considered in effect.
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * === Troop Size Tags ===
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * <Extend: x>
 * <Extend: x, x, x>
 * 
 * - Used for: Troop Name Tags and Troop Comment Tags
 * - Adds enemies from another troop to the current troop.
 * - Enemies from another troop will retain their database positions.
 * - Replace 'x' with the ID of the database troop entry you wish to add enemy
 *   members from.
 *   - Insert multiple x's to add from more troops.
 * - Extended troop members will be added in the order they're listed.
 * - Be cautious of how many enemies you add as too many will lag the battle
 *   system. We are not responsible for frame drops due to this.
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * === Troop Comment Tags ===
 * 
 * Place these tags inside of a comment found in a troop page's event list.
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * <Once Parallel When Start Battle>
 * 
 * - Used for: Troop Page Comment Tags
 * - Causes the troop page to immediately load the moment the battle scene
 *   begins to fade in (not after it fades in). This is faster than a turn 0
 *   condition troop page. Troop page conditions are ignored.
 * - This can be used for things like the Action Sequence Camera plugin, the
 *   Visual Battle Environment plugin, and/or initial battle poses and such in
 *   order to provide a near seamless battle transition experience.
 * - This does NOT trigger when coming out of the options menu or party menu.
 * - This WILL trigger when going from battle to battle nonstop via plugins
 *   like VisuStella MZ's Chain Battles.
 * - When actors are moving towards their home positions, it will take around
 *   30 frames by default. Use this information however you like.

 *
 * ============================================================================
 * Action Sequence - Plugin Commands
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * Skills and items, when used in battle, have a pre-determined series of
 * actions to display to the player as a means of representing what's going on
 * with the action. For some game devs, this may not be enough and they would
 * like to get more involved with the actions themselves.
 *
 * Action Sequences, added through this plugin, enable this. To give a skill or
 * item a Custom Action Sequence, a couple of steps must be followed:
 *
 * ---
 *
 * 1. Insert the <Custom Action Sequence> notetag into the skill or item's
 *    notebox (or else this would not work as intended).
 * 2. Give that skill/item a Common Event through the Effects box. The selected
 *    Common Event will contain all the Action Sequence data.
 * 3. Create the Common Event with Action Sequence Plugin Commands and/or event
 *    commands to make the skill/item do what you want it to do.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * The Plugin Commands added through the Battle Core plugin focus entirely on
 * Action Sequences. However, despite the fact that they're made for skills and
 * items, some of these Action Sequence Plugin Commands can still be used for
 * regular Troop events and Common Events.

 * ============================================================================
 * Plugin Parameters: In-Battle Status Window
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * Added with Battle Core version 1.84, this new window allows the player to
 * view the status of the current active party. If the actors have states and
 * buffs, the player can scroll through them and read about their effects
 * through the help window.
 * 
 * If you would like to manage which parameters can appear here, this can be
 * done through the VisuMZ_0_CoreEngine's "Parameter Settings" and adjust which
 * parameters are shown through "Extended Parameters". These settings will
 * reflect in the In-Battle Status window, too. Otherwise, the parameters that
 * will be shown will only be MaxHP, MaxMP, ATK, DEF, MAT, MDF, AGI, and LUK.
 * 
 * The In-Battle Status can also be used to view enemies (if the parameter is
 * enabled). To view enemies, players must scroll through all the actors before
 * viewing enemies. Enemies will have their battler graphic displayed. If the
 * enemy has a SV Battler graphic, that will be displayed instead. However, if
 * the enemy has a Dragonbones, then the database battler graphic is displayed
 * to match any of the turn order displays as those also use the same graphic.
 * 
 * Enemies will not display the current HP on their In-Battle Status gauges.
 * Instead, they will display what percentage their HP, MP, and/or TP is at.
 * This is primarily due to how gauges do not support large numbers well and
 * showing the percentage values are better for this scene.

 * ============================================================================
 * 
 * Version 1.88: September 18, 2025
 * * Documentation Update!
 * ** Help file updated for new features.
 * * New Features!
 * ** New notetag added by Olivia:
 * *** <Damage Flinch>
 * **** Normally, MP and TP actions do not cause damage flinching. However,
 *      skills and items with this notetag will cause damage flinching if they
 *      hurt the target's MP or TP.
 * **** HP damage will always be affected and cause target to flinch.
 * ** New Plugin Parameter added by Olivia:
 * *** Plugin Parameters > Damage Settings > Check Formulas?
 * **** It's usually bad practice to put in battle mechanics within damage
 *      formulas and this will check the damage formulas for skills and items
 *      to see if they contain any of the common battle mechanics that have the
 *      potential to cause problems.
 * **** Checks for illegal mechanics inside of damage formulas?
 * **** (ie. gainHp, loseHp, addBuff, addDebuff, addState, etc)
 * **** Read the following article for an explanation on why battle mechanics
 *      in damage formulas are undesirable and for an alternate solution:
 * **** http://www.yanfly.moe/wiki/Stop_Putting_Mechanics_in_Damage_Formulas
 * **** Turn this off if you do not want to be alerted of which skills/items
 *      have battle mechanics in their damage formulas.

 *     descriptions and State Tooltips' state descriptions.

 * **** Default values are left at 0 as to not interrupt currently existing
 *      action sequences.
 * 
 * Version 1.84: September 19, 2024

 *      in order to provide a near seamless battle transition experience.

 *      Plugin Parameter "Auto Notetag" on for applying the notetag
 *      <Custom Action Sequence> to every skill and item with common events.
 * **** This will allow items and skills to be able to launch their common
 *      events from the menu scene regardless of the inherent restriction to
 *      prevent action sequence based skills/items with common events from
 *      launching.
 * **** Ignore this if you have "Auto Notetag" disabled or set to false. By
 *      default, this setting is set to false. Please be aware of the changes

 * *** New parameter added: Dual/Multi Wield?
 * **** Add times struck based on weapon quantity equipped?
 * * New Features!
 * ** Dual Wielding now functions differently. Made by Olivia.
 * *** Previously, RPG Maker MZ had "Dual Wielding" attack using both weapon
 *     animations at once, with the combined ATK of each weapon. It's confusing
 *     to look at and does not portray the nature of "Dual Wielding".
 * *** Dual Wielding, or in the case of users adding in third and fourth
 *     weapons, Multi Wielding is now changed. Each weapon is displayed
 *     individually, each producing its own attack animation, showing each
 *     weapon type, and applying only that weapon's ATK, Traits, and related
 *     effects. It is no longer a combined effect to display everything at once
 *     like RPG Maker MZ default.
 * *** If an actor has multiple weapon slots but some of them are unequipped,
 *     then the action will treat the attack as a single attack. There will be
 *     no barehanded attack to add on top of it. This is to match RPG Maker
 *     MZ's decision to omit a second animation if the same scenario is
 *     applied.
 * ** New Action Sequence Plugin Commands added by Yanfly
 * *** ANIM: Attack Animation 2+
 * **** Plays the animation associated with the user's 2nd weapon.
 *      Plays nothing if there is no 2nd weapon equipped.

 * *** WEAPON: Clear Weapon Slot
 * *** WEAPON: Next Weapon Slot

 * ** New Plugin Parameter snuck in by Arisu!
 * *** Plugin Parameters > Action Sequences > Quality of Life > Auto Notetag
 * **** Automatically apply the <Custom Action Sequence> notetag effect to any
 *      item or skill that has a Common Event?
 * **** Any item or skill without a Common Event attached to it will use the
 *      Automatic Action Sequences instead.
 * **** The <Auto Action Sequence> notetag will disable this effect for that
 *      particular skill or item.
 * ** Arisu, you're going to be responsible for any bugs these may cause.
